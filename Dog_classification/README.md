# Dog Classification using Deep Learning

This project implements a deep learning model to classify dog breeds. The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), leveraging Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, and Data Augmentation techniques to improve performance. The dataset consists of dog images, and the goal is to predict the correct breed for each image.

## Project Overview

- **Model Architecture**: Convolutional layers with MaxPooling
- **Data Augmentation**: Applied to prevent overfitting and enhance the generalization of the model.
- **Framework**: TensorFlow / Keras

## Dataset

The dataset includes images of various dog breeds. It is split into training, validation, and test sets for model training and evaluation. You can download the dataset from [https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1sj62C-9WKD09-8iYSeEvXmAGQoY2oFFQ&export=download&authuser=0]

## Model Summary

The model consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max pooling layers to extract features from the input images. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, zoom, and flipping are applied to improve generalization.
