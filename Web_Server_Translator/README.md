# Web Server Translator

A **web-based translation service** built with **FastAPI** that utilizes a **deep learning model** for translating text from one language to another. The server runs a background task to handle translations, providing a responsive, asynchronous API to request translations and retrieve results efficiently.

## Features

- **RESTful API**: Built using FastAPI for efficient and high-performance web interactions.
- **Deep Learning-powered Translations**: Translations are handled by a deep learning model to provide accurate and context-aware results.
- **Asynchronous Task Handling**: Background tasks are used to handle translation requests without blocking the API.
- **Swagger UI Integration**: The API includes automatic documentation via Swagger UI, accessible at `/docs`.
- **ngrok Integration**: Expose your FastAPI app securely using ngrok for easy testing and external access.

## Project Structure

- **FastAPI**: For creating and managing API routes and handling requests.
- **Deep Learning Model**: A pre-trained model is used to perform translations.
- **BackgroundTasks**: FastAPI's background task functionality is used to run translation jobs asynchronously, improving performance and user experience.
- **ngrok**: Used to expose the API to the internet for public use or external testing.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following:

- Python 3.7+
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn
- Pydantic
- ngrok (optional, for exposing the local server)

Install dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn nest_asyncio pyngrok
